When a site programmatically focuses a contenteditable div before editing or text selections are made, and that div is then edited followed by editing ending in a manner which preserves the text selection (i.e clicking a button element), scrollable areas should remain scrollable.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
